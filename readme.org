* Run elisp files without mucking up $HOME/.emacs.d | [[https://travis-ci.org/ldenman/elisp-sandbox][https://travis-ci.org/ldenman/elisp-sandbox.svg?branch=master]]

The goal here is to showcase different types of emacs configuration. Emacs uses
$HOME/.emacs.d by default. The /run.sh/ command takes care of replacing $HOME
with a temporary directory.

* Launch Emacs with a particular config:

** Vanilla
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./run.sh vanilla.el
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** Minimal
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./run.sh minimal.el
  #+END_EXAMPLE
